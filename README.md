# A vanity BTC and LTC address generator

### Use this in the [browser](https://joshua-zou.github.io/vanity-btc/), or as a desktop [app](https://github.com/Joshua-Zou/vanity-btc/releases/tag/v1.3.1)

## What's a vanity address?

A vanity address is an address which part of it is chosen by yourself, making it look less random.  
Examples:  1hellot661JXGRd7XzvmB7H8nsUZuw24U, or  1J6XiPDfPSwBBBBBBBU19y8DNTYt86jNaS

## How it works

Enter the phrase of your choice, select where you would like to place it, (prefix/suffix/anywhere) and click ‘generate’ to start. Your browser will generate lots of random addresses until one matches your input.  
Once an address is found, you can reveal the private key.  
You can increase the number of working threads to reach higher speeds, or decrease it if you device struggles.  

## Security

As explained above, everything is computed only in your browser or app. Nothing ever leaves your machine, or even your browser tab. There is no database, no server-side code. Everything vanishes when you close your tab or app.  
  
**Vanity-BTC cannot and will never store your private key**, and if you don't trust it, you have 3 ways to ensure your key remains private:  
- Once the web page is loaded, you can turn off the internet and continue playing, it will work seamlessly  
- You can also download the latest build of Vanity-BTC  [here](https://github.com/Joshua-Zou/vanity-btc)  and use it on a completely offline computer  
- The code is 100% open source and available on  [Github](https://github.com/Joshua-Zou/vanity-btc). You can review it as much as you want before using it 
- You can [download](https://github.com/Joshua-Zou/vanity-btc/releases/tag/v1.3.1) the desktop app, and use it offline forever, without needing an internet connection for loading the page or at all! 
  

## Performance

For some reason, the performance of Vanity-BTC can vary a lot from a browser to another. Currently, The Desktop App provides the best results with the most security, but for browsers, chrome comes in at a close second.  
Using Vanity-BTC on your phone or tablet will work, but don't expect to reach the speed of a good old (super) computer.

## Compatibility

Any address generated with Vanity-BTC is can be used as any normal wallet!
